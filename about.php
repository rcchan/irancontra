 <table border=0>
 <tr>
 <td><p>This project evolved from an applied ethics and public policy course at Brown University called Good Government. The course examines several concepts that have been promoted in the name of good government, including integrity, accountability, and transparency. The course also examines Watergate and subsequent political scandals. </p>
   <p>How to cover the Iran-Contra Affairs has posed a serious challenge. The most comprehensive book on the matter is Theodore Draperâ€™s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Very-Thin-Line-Iran-Contra-Affairs/dp/0671778145" class="content_link"><em>A Very Thin Line: The Iran-Contra Affairs</em></a>. But the book is 700 pages long and it is out of print.&nbsp; There is not a single website devoted exclusively to this subject like there is for <a href="http://www.watergate.info/" class="content_link">Watergate</a>.&nbsp; This website is intended to fill that gap and provide an educational resource with extensive materials about the issue. </p>
   <p>We were fortunate that C-SPAN starting posting digitized video from the Iran-Contra hearings in the spring of 2010. We selected and have embedded over 100 clips from the hearings. We also gratefully acknowledge the <a href="http://nsarchive.chadwyck.com." class="content_link">National Security Archive</a> and ProQuest LLC for permission to make a host of documents freely available on this site. </p>
   <p>This project was supported by an <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Dean_of_the_College/utra/" class="content_link">Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award</a> (UTRA) from the Dean of the College and by the Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions. The project was supervised by <a href="http://research.brown.edu/research/profile.php?id=10061" class="content_link">Professor Ross Cheit</a>. The students who conducted the research and created the content were: Sara Chimene-Weiss, Sol Eppel, Jeremy Feigenbaum, Seth Motel, and Ingrid Pangandoyon. The site was designed by Ingrid Pangandoyon.&nbsp; </p></td>
