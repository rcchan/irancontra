Daniel Inouye (D-HI), the chair of the Senate Select Committee, called the hearing to order by saying he hoped that the facts of the &ldquo;sad affair&rdquo; would be revealed.&nbsp; Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-IN), the chair of the House Select Committee, predicted that the hearings would prove that &ldquo;many things went wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sen. Warren Rudman (R-NH), vice chair of the Senate committee, asked if the &ldquo;foreign policy process&rdquo; was &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; or &ldquo;simply ignored.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rep. Dick Cheney (R-WY), the ranking Republican on the House committee, largely defended President Ronald Reagan and the power of the Executive Branch.</p><p>With those opening statements, the first of 41 incisive, fascinating days of hearings began.&nbsp; For three months, television cameras would capture all the action.&nbsp; On this site, we feature about 100 clips of testimony involving 13 key figures as well as several members of the special congressional committees formed to investigate the affair.',

Warren Rudman, vice chair of the Senate committee.&nbsp; McFarlane told the panel that he did not want any special treatment because of his recent overdose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shoot your best shot,&rdquo; he declared.',

Abrams\' testimony turned out to be among the most contentious of the hearings.&nbsp; He consistently denied knowing&mdash;or wanting to know&mdash;key aspects of the U.S. involvement in Nicaragua, which prompted Rep.

Gen. Richard Secord (Ret.), Hakim ran the Enterprise as a business, not a humanitarian organization.&nbsp; When Hakim was questioned by the committees, he had profited several-million dollars by helping turn money from Nicaragua into arms for Iran.&nbsp; Hakim\'s testimony featured many notable statements&mdash;from his description of his &ldquo;love&rdquo; for Lt. Col. Oliver North to his plans for a war with Russia over Iran.&nbsp; Hakim justified using the Enterprise\'s profits, which the committees argue should belong to the U.S., in order to fund $200,000 of death benefits for North\'s family.&nbsp; Ultimately, Co-Chairman Sen.

North Will Tell His Story to Nation: The Villain Who Deceived or Hero Who Obeyed?&rdquo;&nbsp; Readers of <em>Washingtonian</em> magazine had voted Lt. Col. Oliver North the top villain of the year&mdash;and the biggest hero.&nbsp; It would have been an understatement to call &ldquo;Ollie&rdquo; a conundrum.&nbsp; Without a doubt, North was expected to be the star witness of the hearings.&nbsp; Starting the morning of the 7th, he did not disappoint.&nbsp; Just as the American people were listening to North\'s testimony from day one, they were also watching the spectacle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The day-long show proved again that Washington can still outdo Hollywood in the production of high-yield dramatic blockbusters,&rdquo; declared <em>The Washington Post</em>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was he the good guy, the bad guy or the fall guy?&rdquo; asked The<em> Chicago Tribune</em>.&nbsp; &ldquo;On Tuesday he revealed himself as the wise guy.&rdquo;</p><p>Taking place over six straight weekdays, North provided plenty of substance, too.&nbsp; At the start, he vowed, &ldquo;I came here to tell you the truth&mdash;the good, the bad, and the ugly.&rdquo;&nbsp; He acknowledged shredding key documents, but North maintained that his actions were in line with what his superiors wanted.&nbsp; North claimed that he saw a signed presidential Finding to ship arms to Iran and that President Reagan was aware of the private fundraising for the Contras.&nbsp; He also disclosed that the late CIA Director William Casey was aware of North\'s activities, but he deliberately kept the secretaries of state and defense out of the loop.&nbsp; Indeed, North aimed to ensure &ldquo;plausible deniability&rdquo; among his superiors (including Reagan).<br /><br />For all their serious topics, the North hearings will rightly be remembered in part due to their entertainment value.&nbsp; When questioned about using Enterprise money for a home security system, North told a compelling story about being willing to subject himself, but not his family, to a fight with terrorists.&nbsp; Referring to a prominent terrorist, he said, &ldquo;I will be glad to meet Abu Nidal on equal terms anywhere in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dramatically, he defended his actions by saying that &ldquo;lying does not come easy&rdquo; to him, but he had to consider &ldquo;the difference between lives and lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brendan Sullivan, North\'s tenacious lawyer, also joined in on the theatrics.&nbsp; By far the most vocal of all the witnesses\' lawyers, Sullivan objected frequently and declared that he was there as a lawyer, &ldquo;not a potted plant.&rdquo;&nbsp; The panel members became emotive, as well.&nbsp; Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) made a public plea against future prosecution for North; Co-Chairman Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-IN) lectured North on patriotism.</p><p>Finally, Co-Chairman Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-HI), a World War II hero, wrapped up the six days with a memorable speech.&nbsp; Inouye reminded North about cadet honor, declaring, &ldquo;Members of the military have an obligation to disobey unlawful orders.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inouye made reference to the Nuremberg Trials, which set off Sullivan, who interrupted the co-chairman to say that his closing statement was &ldquo;personally and professionally distasteful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Undeterred, Inouye responded and then finished his speech with a Thomas Jefferson quotation about the importance of &ldquo;the spirit of resistance to government.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, on July 14, North\'s week of testimony came to an end.&nbsp; As <em>The Washington Post </em>wrote, this section of the hearings proved to be &ldquo;suspenseful, eventful and surprising up to the last scene of the last act.&rdquo;',

Paul Trible (R-VA) questioned Poindexter\'s adherence to the Naval Honor Code, Poindexter defended himself by declaring, &ldquo;I don\'t have any regrets for anything that I did.&rdquo;',

George Mitchell (D-ME) riled the secretary of state when he asked if Reagan was keeping him &ldquo;in the dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shultz then became engaged with Rep.

Warren Rudman (R-NH), George Mitchell (D-ME), and Sam Nunn (R-GA) each criticized Meese for the carelessness of his internal investigation.&nbsp; Sen. Rudman, the Senate committee\'s leading Republican, told Meese that loyal subordinates such as North and Poindexter should have been asked to tell Reagan their interpretation of the truth.&nbsp; Sen. Mitchell engaged in contentious discussions with the attorney general about why he did not take notes at certain meetings in that period and why he failed to secure documents earlier.&nbsp; When Sen. Nunn asked Meese why he did not corroborate North\'s account with Poindexter, he said he aimed to &ldquo;get a coherent story&rdquo; on Iran, but he just wanted to get &ldquo;the essential facts&rdquo; on the Diversion.',
