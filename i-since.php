Iran Since Iran-Contra</h2>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
  <p>The U.S.-Iran relationship has continued on a difficult course. Iran remains the religious state established during the Revolution and has become more fundamentalist in recent years. Tensions have heightened, largely due to current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s strong anti-Israel position and his desire to develop nuclear power, which he now says Iran possesses (many around the world believe that Iran seeks to develop nuclear weapons). In addition, Ahmadinejad has deemed both the Holocaust and 9/11 to be falsehoods, igniting U.S. and international anger. A highly disputed election in 2009, in which Ahmadinejad claimed victory over former Prime Minister Mir Hossain Mousavi, resulted in massive protests in Iran. These protests were met with harsh violence by Ahmadinejad’s government and were ultimately quelled. Nonetheless, divisions among the Iranian elite remain following the election. </p>
