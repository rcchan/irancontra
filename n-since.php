Nicaragua Since Iran-Contra</h2>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
  <p>The Nicaraguan civil war between the Sandinistas and the contras, coupled with Sandinista economic policy, contributed greatly to economic decline in Nicaragua.&nbsp; The two sides signed a peace deal in 1987, and elections were held in 1990.&nbsp; The Bush Administration, which had gradually ended aid to the contras, gave financial support to the political opposition.&nbsp; Elections were held in 1990, and Violeta Chamorro, (Pedro Joaquín Chamorro’s widow) of the National Opposition Union (UNO), won the presidency.&nbsp; She attempted to reverse many policies of the Sandinista regime and was successful in introducing free-market reforms, human rights protections, and democratization.&nbsp; Animosity between former contras and Sandinistas was strong––and sometimes violent––through the mid-1990s; however, President Chamorro did make progress in national reconciliation.&nbsp; <br />

    In 1997, Arnoldo Aléman became president after winning elections the previous year.&nbsp; His administration was corrupt, however, and in 2001, Enrique Bolaños became president.&nbsp; He attempted to bolster Nicaragua’s economy, which today remains among the worst in Latin America, by introducing various reforms.&nbsp; In 2006, Daniel Ortega of the FSLN was reelected as president; however, he no longer espouses the Socialism of his past.&nbsp; Instead, his “government focused on the difficult task of stamping out official corruption and improving general economic conditions, particularly for poorer Nicaraguans.”</p>
  Today, relations between the United States and Nicaragua are normal.&nbsp; Both countries maintain embassies in the other.&nbsp; The United States continues to push for free-market reforms, democratization, and economic improvement.&nbsp; Indeed, Nicaragua is part of the Central America––Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, a free trade agreement that includes the United States, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.&nbsp; The United States also seeks to better human rights in Nicaragua, including through judicial reform, and to assist Nicaragua in combating crime and terrorism.
