<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">

<h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
  <ul>
    <li>Were      the prosecutions in the Iran-Contra matter legitimate criminal cases or      did they involve the criminalization of foreign policy? Presumably one key      factor in assessing this question is the extent to which the parties were      acting out of a strong sense of patriotism. How important is that factor?      What other factors are important? </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Is      there a difference between how the arguments above apply to covert actions      versus how they apply to an active cover-up after they have been exposed?  </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>When,      if ever, should lying to Congress be prosecuted as a crime? What are the      most plausible reasons for exercising the prosecutorial discretion to <em>decline</em> to prosecute such cases? </li>
