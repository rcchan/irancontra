<div style="width:325px"><font class="transcript"><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Did there come a time when you received a call from
an Israeli representative telling you that as a result, an American
hostage would be allowed to go free?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:  Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Was that a very unpleasant call?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:  Well, it was extremely disappointing.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Tell us about the call.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:  Well, it was the report from Mr. Kimche in
Israel that, as a practical matter, they had run into difficulties
with the Iranian intermediaries, that nonetheless, he believed that
while his expectations that all hostages would be released had not
been fulfilled, or would not be fulfilled, that we ought to continue
the dialogue with them anyway, and that the United States could
expect one hostage to be released within a couple of days.
His call must have been on or about the 10th to 12th of September.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Were you asked to play God and choose one hostage?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:  Yes. And I asked for Mr. Buckley.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: And that was the subject of some anguish to be put
in the position of having to choose?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:  Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  And it brought home to you, I take it, what it really
meant to be negotiating for hostages?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:  Well, it was very clear that this was not a-the
kind of exchange that was proper.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  And did you report to the President that as a result
of the Israeli shipment, a hostage would be released?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:  Yes, I did.
