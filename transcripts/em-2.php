<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Now, from your notes, I take it, that Mr. Regan had inquired
who authorized the shipment, who knew, was RR told.<br/><br/>

Did anyone ask the President or did the President respond in any way to that question?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: Not that I can recall, and I have made no notations
that he did. This was not necessarily a verbatim account of what was going on. It was notes that
I took to refresh my recollection, but I have no notation here as to anything the President might
have said at that stage.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Following the NSPG meeting, did you arrange an interview with
Admiral Poindexter?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: Yes. For some reason I wasn't able to reach him in the morning and so I did
go up to his office immediately following the NSPG meeting and had a conversation with him at that
time.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: How long?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: I would say it was a very short conversation, probably about
5 or 10 minutes, because I was due in the President's office as soon as I could after that meeting,
but I did want to see Admiral Poindexter before I saw the President.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Would you describe your conversation with Admiral Poindexter?<br/><br/>

<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: Yes. I described to Admiral Poindexter what we had
found, that we had found a memorandum that indicated a diversion of funds. I indicated that
we had talked with Colonel North, that Colonel North had verified that there was such a scheme
and that a quantity of money had been taken from the so-called profits of the arms transactions
and had been transferred through a series of bank accounts to the Freedom Fighters, and that,
told him, in essence, what we had found.<br/><br/>
  
And I asked him whether he knew about this, and he said that, and I believe his exact words or
close to his exact words, "Ollie has given me enough hints about this so that I generally knew,
but I did nothing to follow up or stop it" or words to that effect.<br/><br/>
  
And then I asked him, I said, have you told anyone else or does anyone else in the White House know?
And he said, no.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Was that the sum and substance of your conversation?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: I think those were the salient parts of the conversation.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Did you ask him whether he had ever received a final version of the document that you
had talked to Colonel North about?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: No, I did not. I didn't go into any more detail than that. Those were the
key elements that I wanted to know before I talked to the President and then since I was already late for the President's
office, I went there almost directly.<br/><br/>
  
I may have stopped by to pick up Don Regan or he may have already been in the President's office, but Admiral Poindexter did
not go with me at that time.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Did you ask him whether there had been any other documents referring to the diversion which
had been sent up the line by Colonel North?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: No. I asked him only whether he had told anyone else or anyone else in the
White House knew and he said no.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Did you ask him whether he had told the President?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: Implicitly, yes, when I asked who else in the White House knew or whether he told
anyone else in the White House, and he said no.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Now, Admiral Poindexter testified before this committee that he did not recall your asking him
whether he had told the President. Did you make any notes of that interview?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: No, I did not.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Was there anyone else there?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: No, I was the only one with him, and I did not actually ask him in the exact
words "did you tell the President?" I said, "did you tell anyone else in the White House or does anyone else in the
White House know?"<br/><br/>
  
I think I may have related to him what Colonel North said about who knew.<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Did you ask him whether he had approved of the diversion?<br/><br/>
  
<strong>Attorney General MEESE</strong>: I didn't ask him separately, he had already indicated what his participation was
in the words that I mentioned to you, that he knew enough about it, that he knew what was going on, had a general knowledge,
but that he did nothing to either follow up on that or stop it.
