<strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Now, between July of 1984 and 1986 when the
U.S. Government funding resumed, you spent approximately $19
million for arms and ammunition, correct?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. CALERO</strong>: Correct, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Prior to July of 1984, had you had any experience in purchasing weapons?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. CALERO</strong>: No, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: How did you determine what arms to buy and
how much to pay for them?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. CALERO</strong>: Well, I knew what was being used and we had prepared before, with the CIA, a budget, which listed all the materials
that we were going to buy with the new funding, which never
came, butâ€”so I knew what we had to get and I consulted with our
military men.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Did you also consult with Colonel North?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. CALERO</strong>: Oh, I told him, I used to tell Colonel North practically everything. I had no reservation. I had full confidence and
trust in him.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: So you discussed your purchases with Colonel
North in advance, is that right?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. CALERO</strong>: I discussed our needs and probably told him that I
was going to purchase, yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Did you also tell him after you made a purchase
what you had purchased and how much you had paid and who you
had bought it from?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. CALERO</strong>: Yes. Yes.
