<div style="width:325px"><font class="transcript"><strong>Mr. NUNN</strong>: Wrapping it all up because the yellow light is on,
how do we operate in the executive branch? Forget about Congress.
Forget about the Intelligence Committee. How does the executive
branch operate when so many people are misleading so many other
people and particularly with you in a key position, and you were
being misled over and over and over again according to your testimony.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. ABRAMS</strong>: You can't operate that way and I think that we, in
the executive branch and you, in the Congress know the way in
which that was operating in the executive branch was a disaster,
and the thing just fell apart.
It was being operated by the NSC keeping the Department of
State in the dark, and that is a formula for disaster.
