<strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Now, sometime during the afternoon on Friday,
November 21, 1986, did Colonel North hand you several documents
and ask you to make changes?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Would you describe generally what he handed to
you and what he asked you to do?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: I was sitting at my desk, and he came outside his
office and handed me three or four original System 4 packages
with changes indicated on them, I believe, in red or blue, I think—I
am not sure—and asked me to make the changes, and I did so.
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: And they were handwritten changes on original
4 documents?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: So, as far as you knew where had those original
System 4 documents been up until that point?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: I have no idea, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Did you recognize them as completed documents?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: So that, ordinarily those documents would have
the original files maintained by the System 4 security officer
right next door to your office, correct?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Who by that time in November was Brian Merchant?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Did you recognize the handwriting on the original, 
System 4 documents that Colonel North gave you?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Whose handwriting was it?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Colonel North's.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Up until that time, Ms. Hall, had you ever been
asked by Colonel North or anyone else to make changes to original,
completed System 4 documents?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: I don't believe so, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Did you make the changes that Colonel North indicated?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: And did you destroy the marked-up originals that
Colonel North gave you with the changes written in?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, I did.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Did Colonel North ask you to destroy those
marked-up originals?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: I don't know if he told me to destroy them or if I destroyed them on my own initiative.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: You understand from the circumstances exactly
what you were expected to do?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
