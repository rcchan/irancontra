<div style="width:325px"><font class="transcript"><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Did you also meet with Vice President Bush
prior to going to the Central American country?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: Yes, sir. I asked Mr. Gregg that I had an interest
in meeting the Vice President, so he arranged for me—I believe it
was the 29th of January—for a very, very brief meeting
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: That is 1985?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: 1985. It was not even recorded. I was just to go
in and shake hands. We spent a little longer time, because as I
recall, it was a news program where they had the Vice President's
family, so we watch it together, and I show him my album, and he
was very interested in my life story.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Did you tell the Vice President that you intended to go to this Central American country to assist them with your
helicopter concept?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: Yes, I did, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Did you have any discussion with the Vice
President at that time about the Contras?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: No, sir. None whatsoever.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: How long did that meeting last?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: Well, it took probably a little bit longer than we
expected, because he was actually watching a TV program with his
family. Actually, our conversation was specifically showing my
album. I even brought him an album where I have a picture taken
with Che Guevera and others, and I think it was very interesting
for him to see it. After that, we shook hands, and I left.
