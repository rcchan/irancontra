<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  And am I correct that you answered yesterday that
you haven't yet decided whether you are prepared to waive?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  I believe my answer was that I probably will sign
the waiver. I am inclined to do so. I have to consult with my counsel on this matter just as soon as these hearings are over.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  But you have had some four months to consult; am I
correct?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  Not on this particular request. We didn't know we
were going to be asked to do this. I was coming voluntarily to prepare before you. I didn't come to be badgered by these questions I
have answered already repeatedly.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Have you not had this request before you since January to waive?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  I relied on the advice of my counsel. Let's get off the
subject.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  You are making the rulings?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  No, sir. But I did not come here to be badgered.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  And you are not prepared as you sit here today to
say that these records can be available to the committees?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  My answer stands.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Fine.
