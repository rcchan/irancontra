<strong>Chairman INOUYE</strong>: Colonel North, we are just about finished. Do you have any final
statement to make, sir?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. NORTH</strong>: A very brief one, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Chairman INOUYE</strong>: Please proceed.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. NORTH</strong>: I would simply like to thank the American people
who have responded with their good wishes, their support, their
prayers through what has been for me and my family a long and
difficult ordeal. I thank them for that, and I salute them.
That is my statement, sir.
