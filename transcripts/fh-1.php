<strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: I would like to turn now to the Iran matter and the
events of November. But before we do, I want to clear up one other
point that has been raised before the committees. Do you remember a time in or about early June of 1986, when you were asked by
Colonel North to type an account number on a card?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: And do you recall Assistant Secretary Elliott
Abrams was present at that time?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: I thought there was someone else, but now I realize it
was Secretary Abrams, yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Your best recollection now is that Secretary
Abrams was present?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: This was in your office at Suite 302?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: And would you describe please for the committees
what happened?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: I was sitting at my desk, Colonel North passed me a
piece of paper with an account number on it and asked me to type
it. I pulled out a 3-by-5 index card, typed what I saw, and returned
the slip of paper he had given me and the card.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: To Colonel North?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: As far as you know, you typed on the card precisely
the account number which Colonel North gave you on the slip of
paper?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: And you understand from subsequent events that
that is the account number which has come into controversy in
connection with a contribution from Brunei?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: When you handed the paperâ€”after you handed the
paper and the card with the number to Colonel North typed as you
saw the number on the slip, that was the last time you saw or
heard about that?
<br/><br/><strong>Ms. HALL</strong>: Yes, sir.
