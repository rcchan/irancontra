<strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: And this proposal which called for the release of all
of the American hostages was not accepted at that meeting; am I
correct?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: That's correct. They didn't find this within their
power to achieve and they did not want to lie like the past.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: And when you say they didn't want to lie like in the
past, you understood that in the past they had promised that the
hostages would be released, or at least some of them had promised?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: My understanding was that during the life of the
first channel, Mr. Ghorbanifar would tell everything that the
Americans wanted to hear.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: And they heard what pleased them?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: Correct. There is no question about that.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: But even at this late date, which is October, after
you had been working on this second channel since July, Colonel
North still was contemplating that all of the hostages would be released; correct?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: Colonel North not only had the desire of re-establishing the relationship with Iran, it did not for a moment leave his
mind the American hostages being kept in Lebanon. That was in
his mind at all times.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: Did he tell you that he was under political pressure
to get them released?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: He did not have such a discussion with me, but that
was my definite impression and understanding, that that was the
case.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: Well, what gave you that impression?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: When we got closer to the time for the elections, my
understanding was that Colonel North wanted to remove this obstacle for the purpose of enhancing the President's position.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: Well, did you reach the conclusion and so testify to it
that you believed that his—North's prime objective was to get the
hostages released in time for the elections?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: I would say this would be unfair to say that it was
his prime objective. But definitely he was trying to achieve that
goal.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: If you look at page 202 of May 31, would you tell me
whether you testified that that was your impression of Colonel
North, namely that it was his prime objective to get the hostages
released in time for the election?
Mr. JANIS. Could we just have a moment?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: Sure. It begins at line 14.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: I've read that, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: Was it true what you testified?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: What I testified is correct, sir, but my understanding
of your question is different than the context that is in my deposition.
Here I am advising Colonel North that his strategy for negotiation is wrong. Colonel North wanted to achieve—as I earlier testified a few moments ago—he wanted to achieve both. And I told
him, as I testified here, that this is a wrong approach to put his
emphasis and show as his prime objective the release of hostages.
I told him, as I testified, he should low key that and he should
put his attention more on the long-term relationship.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: Mr. Hakim
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: There is no question Colonel North wanted to get the
hostages out as quickly as possible.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: Mr. Hakim?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: If you misspoke at your deposition, you can so state.
Mr. JANIS. Well, I think
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>: Would you look at that passage and tell me whether
or not that statement is still something that you stand by? If it is, I
will read it. If it is not, I won't.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. HAKIM</strong>: You should read the whole thing, sir. If you want to,
go back. You are taking part, only a small part of my whole testimony in connection with this subject. Let's go further.
