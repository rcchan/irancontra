<strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: And did Mr. McFarlane tell you that it was then
proposed that Israel would send an air shipment-through a European
city- of some 100 HAWKs to Iran?
<br/><br/><strong>Secretary SHULTZ</strong>: Yes. That was- he described the structure of a
deal in which a plane would go from I think someplace in Portugal,
as I remember, and it would be contingent on release of the hostages,
a rather complex arrangement.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: But the burden of it was that if the hostages came
out, the weapons would go to Iran; if they didn't, the weapons
wouldn't?
<br/><br/><strong>Secretary SHULTZ</strong>: Exactly. It was a straight out arms-for-hostages
deal.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: What did you tell Mr. McFarlane?
<br/><br/><strong>Secretary SHULTZ</strong>: I told him I hoped that the hostages would get
out, but I was against it, and I was upset that he was telling me
about it as I was just about to start so there was no way I could do
anything about it.
But anyway, if it was happening, I hoped the hostages would get
out.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: After you objected, though, you learned within the
next several days that no hostages had been released and your information
was that the deal had, therefore, collapsed?
<br/><br/><strong>Secretary SHULTZ</strong>: Exactly.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BELNICK</strong>: Your notes indicate-in the chronology-that you
told your executive assistant on November 23, 1985, it is over?
<br/><br/><strong>Secretary SHULTZ</strong>: That was what I understood.
