<strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: So you told the Vice President about what you
were doing in conjunction with the government of that Central
American country in dealing with the insurgents; is that right?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: That's correct, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Then
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: And I showed him the album that had to do with
my operation there.
I want to make clear that at no point in any of this conversation
did I ever mention doing anything that was remotely connected to
Nicaragua and the Contras.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: You anticipated my next question, Mr. Rodriguez.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: I knew you were coming to that.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Let's be sure we are clear on that.
Did you say anything to Vice President Bush about your activities on behalf of this resupply operation?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: No, sir, not to him or anyone on his staff.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Did you say anything to Vice President Bush
about what Colonel North was doing in connection with the resupply effort?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: No, sir, not at all.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. BARBADORO</strong>: Why didn't you discuss this with Vice President
Bush?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. RODRIGUEZ</strong>: I didn't see a reason why to discuss it when I
went to the area that I went was for something completely different. Now this has become a big issue. At the time it was just—it
wasn't that important. I didn't feel that it was my duty to tell
him—or anybody else, for that matter.
