<strong>Mr. SMILJANICH</strong>: ...Now, you knew at the time that this
was ongoing that the President in September of 1985 had been informed of the 500 Israeli—500 TOWs that had been shipped by
Israel.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. REGAN</strong>: Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SMILJANICH</strong>: And had indicated at that point that he would
not completely rule out the possibility of replenishing those TOWs?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. REGAN</strong>: Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SMILJANICH</strong>: And you also knew at that time that the Israelis' delivery of TOWs was tied to the release of Benjamin Weir?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. REGAN</strong>: Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SMILJANICH</strong>: You knew of the Israeli shipments in November, the HAWK shipments in November of 1985, because you and
the President had been informed of that?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. REGAN</strong>: Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SMILJANICH</strong>: All right.
And no one in connection with those November 1985 shipments
had ever indicated in any way that oil-drilling equipment was
being shipped to Iran; isn't that correct?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. REGAN</strong>: I recall that that was to have been a cover story if
discovered, it was to have been said that these were oil-drilling
parts.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SMILJANICH</strong>: OK.
So, in other words, you and the President understood that
HAWKs were involved in that November 1985 shipment but
that—
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. REGAN</strong>: Certainly.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SMILJANICH</strong>: —oil-drilling equipment was a cover story?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. REGAN</strong>: Sure.
