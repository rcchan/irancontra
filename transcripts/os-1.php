  <p>Chairman INOUYE. </p>
  <p>The joint hearings of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran and the    
    Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and    
    the Nicaraguan Opposition will come to order. </p>
  <p>
    Ladies and gentlemen, 200 years ago, the framers of our Constitution provided for more perfect union by establishing a strong national government built on a system of checks and balances.    
    The Founding Fathers did not believe that effective government    
    and checks and balances were inconsistent. On the contrary, it was    
    their premise that no branch had such a monopoly on truth that it    
    should be free to act with total independence.    The unique genius of the American system was that by dividing    
    power, it promoted sound policy based on reasoned and open discourse and mutual trust between the branches. These hearings this    
    morning and for the days to follow will examine what happens    
    when the trust which is the lubricant of our system is breached by    
    high officials of our government.    </p>
    <p>
    The story is not a pretty one. As it unfolds in these proceedings,    
    the American people will have every right to ask how could this    
    have happened here. And as we answer that question, the American people will have every right to demand that it will never    
    happen again.</p>
  <p>Indeed, it should never have happened at all.    
    The constitutionally mandated relationship between the Executive and Legislative Branches of this Nation has stood the test of    
    time. It has survived the shock of civil war, outlasted the mightiest    
    monarchies and dictatorships, and seen us successfully through the    
    turbulence of world wars.    <br />
    </p>
  <p>There is no reason this same carefully calibrated system could    
    not have guided us through the difficult choices we faced in Central America and Iran.</p><p>
    The formulation of American foreign policy has always been a    
    matter of discourse between the President and Congress. Without    
    detracting from their own primary responsibility, Presidents have    
    understood that Congress has an indispensable role in foreign    
    policy.    </p>
    <p>
    We must ratify the treaties, confirm the major foreign policy officials, authorize and appropriate the funds and exercise the oversight. Bipartisanship in the execution of foreign policy requires    
    prior consultation in the development of foreign policy.    
    In short, it is a working relationship. The President may be the    
    senior partner in foreign policy, but he is not the sole proprietor.    
    Indeed, this fact was seemingly recognized by this Administra-    
    tion. In 1984, the Administration pledged its complete cooperation    
    with Congress. It entered into an unambiguous agreement with the    
    Senate Intelligence Committee promising advance notification of    
    anticipated covert activities.    </p>
    <p>
    As recently as the summer of 1986, the Director of Central Intel-    
    ligence reaffirmed this agreement and lauded the successful partnership that had developed between the Executive and the Intelligence Committee.    </p><p>
    But at the very moment these promises of cooperation, notifica-    
    tion, and partnership were being made and reaffirmed, the secret    
    chain of events which would explode in the Iran/Contra affair was    
    well in motion.    </p>
    <p>
    The story is one not of covert activity alone, but of covert foreign    
    policy. Not secret diplomacy, which Congress has always accepted,    
    but secret policy making, which the Constitution has always rejected.    </p>
    <p>
    It is a tale of working outside the system, and of utilizing irregular channels and private parties accountable to no one on matters    
    of national security while ignoring the Congress and even the tra-    
    ditional agencies of executive foreign policymaking.   </p>
    <p> 
    The story is both sad and sordid; it is filled with inconsistencies    
    and often unexplainable conduct. None of the participants emerges    
    unblemished. People of great character and ability holding positions of trust and authority in our government were drawn into a    
    web of deception and despair.    </p>
    <p>
    Congress, too, is not immune from scrutiny in these hearings. We    
    cannot avoid asking whether appropriations bills which changed    
    from year to year and sometimes within the same year were an effective way of controlling foreign policy.    </p><p>
    Nor can we avoid asking whether we were vigilant enough in    
    carrying out our oversight functions.    </p>
    <p>
    Let it be clear, however, that our concern in this inquiry is not    
    with the merits of any particular policy, but with flawed policymaking processes.    </p>
    <p>
    Our hearings are neither pro-Contra nor anti-Contra, neither    
    pro-Administration nor anti-Administration. We are not prosecu-    
    tors; and this is not an adversarial proceeding. We meet here as    
    American citizens, united in a common effort to find the facts lest    
    we repeat the mistakes.    </p>
    <p>
    Our purpose is self-examination, not recrimination. To this end,    
    we will deal with questions of the greatest sensitivity to our national security, questions we address precisely because we in Congress    
    do recognize that the paramount importance of foreign policy. And    
    so we will consider in these hearings the following questions:    
    First, were the statutory restrictions on the United States aid to    
    the Contras violated?    </p><p>
    Second, was Congress misled?    </p>
    <p>
    Third, were the executive branch's own internal checks and balances bypassed in policy decisions in Nicaragua and Iran?   </p><p> 
    Fourth, was there a public foreign policy and simultaneously was    
    there a very different covert foreign policy?    </p><p>
    Fifth, was American foreign policy privatized;    
    And, finally, were decisions on the most significant matters of    
    national security driven or influenced by private profit motives?    
    We do not deal here with civil disagreements over the direction    
    of U.S. foreign policy, or with the creative tensions between the    
    branches of government.    </p><p>
    Those are normal and healthy, and they do not end in shredding    
    of documents. Only a contempt for law leads to altered documents    
    and perjured statements.    </p><p>
    By eliciting and examining the entire story, we believe our    
    Nation will emerge stronger. We also believe that sunlight is the    
    best disinfectant. Our country is not divided or dispirited. These    
    hearings do not represent our democracy's weakness, but its    
    strength.    </p><p>
    This strength and unity of purpose are reflected in the decision    
    of our two committees to conduct these hearings jointly. This was    
    an historic decision, insuring that the public interest would prevail    
    over any parochial interest and that the full story would be pre-    
    sented to the public expeditiously and fairly. This outcome would    
    not have been possible without the cooperation and statesmanship    
    of my colleagues on the House Committee and their distinguished    
    leaders, Congressman Lee Hamilton and Congressman Richard    
    Cheney.    </p><p>
    Another historic feature of this inquiry is the bipartisan spirit    
    that has guided our efforts. Our Senate Committee has a unified    
    staff whose members report to the committee as a whole, not to    
    Democrats or Republicans. The Senate Select Committee has beer:    
    pleased with a staff of extraordinary talent and dedication to    
    match.    </p><p>
    When the history of this period is written, I am certain its footnotes    
  &nbsp;will amply recognize the indispensable contribution of the    
    staff which was ably guided by the chief counsel, Arthur Liman.    
    This usual superlatives cannot describe this man's contribution    
    to this committee. My senior Republican colleague on this panel,    
    the very Honorable Warren Rudman, is this committee's vice    
    chairman and my equal partner in this inquiry.    </p><p>
    He and I have worked closely together, consulting on every issue,    
    reaching joint decisions on every question, striving always towards    
    the same objective. I applaud his leadership. I value his wisdom. I    
    value his counsel.    </p><p>
    So, too, do I recognize the great contributions of every member of    
    our committee. Each Senator has spent many hours preparing for    
    these hearings, reviewing mountains of evidence, pouring over the    
    transcripts and documents on busy days, week nights, and week-    
    ends.    </p>
    <p>
    No one has raised a political issue in private or in public. Not    
    one has sought to turn this matter into partisan or personal advantage.    </p>
    <p>
    All our committee votes on even the most sensitive and potentially divisive questions have been unanimous. This bipartisan    
    spirit has been matched on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue.    
    The White House has been cooperative. Executive privilege has    
    not been asserted. And even the President's personal diaries have    
    been shared with us. The Executive Department has likewise re-    
    sponded to our requests.    </p><p>
    None of this is to say that we and the executive agencies have    
    agreed on every matter. We have had our disagreement. But there    
    they have been minor and also in good faith and most importantly,    
    it has worked.    </p>
    <p>
    It is truly sad that such interbranch cooperation and trust could    
    not have been the rule before, because if it had, we would not be    
    here today. Indeed, we must ask why the bipartisanship which has    
    marked this examination of our foreign policy making process    
    could not be extended to the making of our foreign policy in the    
    future. Some of us believe it can. All of us hope it will.    
    But first we must clear the air and let the facts of this unfortunate and sad affair emerge. So to this end, I call these hearings to    
    order. </p>
