<strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Is it a fact that the weapons that were delivered to
Iran were U.S. weapons?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Is it a fact that Mr. North, Colonel North, dealt directly with the Iranian official?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  After we were able to arrange it, yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Is it a fact that Mr. McFarlane dealt directly with
the Iranian official in Tehran?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  Yes. Secretly.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Was Mr. McFarlane posing as a representative from
Timbuktu or as a representative of the United States?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  Obviously from the United States.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Did you carry over a Bible to the Iranians inscribed
by the President of the United States?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  They did, yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  And you were aware of it?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  Yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  And the President of the United States didn't disguise who he was, did he?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  No.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  So it is still your testimony that the purpose of putting you in as an intermediary was to conceal the fact that the
United States was dealing with Iran from the Iranians?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  Sure. And it makes sense. The Iranians had to be
able to say they were not dealing with the Great Satan directly,
they were dealing with a company, they were dealing through
Europe.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Did Lake ever send a single invoice to the Iranians?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  No.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. LIMAN</strong>:  Did it ever issue a single piece of paper to the Iranians saying you are buying these from Lake?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. SECORD</strong>:  Mr. Nields—excuse me—Mr. Liman, there's no question the covert operation was designed to be concealed from Congress. There is no question of that. I mean, they didn't—they chose
not to notify the Congress. But that wasn't my decision. It wasn't
my decision at all. I wasn't involved in that decision.
