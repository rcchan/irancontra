<strong>Mr. NORTH</strong>: Director Casey and I talked at length on a variety of occasions
about the use of those moneys to support other operations besides
the Nicaraguan operation, and you no doubt have seen records of
my accounting of other activities that were planned beyond the
Nicaraguan Resistance.<br/>
<br/>
We always assumed, not just Director Casey and I, but all those
of us who worked within the Government on this problem of democracy in Central America, that there would come a time again,
as indeed it did, where the Congress would make available the
moneys necessary to support the Nicaraguan Freedom Fighters.
And at various times, he and I talked about the fact that it
might be necessary at some point in the future to have something,
as he would put it, to pull off the shelf and to help support other
activities like that.<br/><br/>
And none of those aside from the ones that we talked about in
terms of cooperation with Israel, the ones I referred to in my notes
as TA-1, 2, and 3, or TH-1, 2, and 3, I don't recall exactly which—
aside from those operations, he was looking forward to the possibility of needing to support other activities beyond that, and that is
why I am not exactly certain as to what perhaps was intended
beyond the use of those moneys for support for the Nicaraguan Resistance and the other purposes that I described to you earlier, in
that I had, I think, communicated that to General Secord and he
did prepare a layout which showed how other of those commercial
entities could be used to support activities in other places besides
Central America and besides the U.S.-Israeli operations, besides the
hostage recovery operations.<br/><br/>
None of those plans were ever put to fruition before all of this
was terminated, but we did talk, he and I, about that and I may
have mentioned it at some point to Admiral Poindexter, although
certainly not in the same detail that Director Casey and I talked
about it.<br/><br/>
It is possible, although I don't recall it, that I may have talked to
Mr. McFarlane about it.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: When you say about it, it is the use of funds for
some other projects besides the Contras?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. NORTH</strong>: Yes. Well now I do—I am certain that I talked to
Admiral Poindexter about the Israeli projects, the ones that are abbreviated with a TA or TH in the records that I provided to the
committee.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: Did you ever tell Director Casey that funds had actually been used to support the Contras, that is funds arising out of
these Iranian arms sales?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. NORTH</strong>: Oh, yes.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. NIELDS</strong>: And I take it on more than one occasion?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. NORTH</strong>: Yes.
