<div style="width:325px"><font class="transcript"><strong>Mr. COHEN</strong> Can I ask you a question as to whether you ever suspected
that Oliver North was taking instructions not from you, but
from the DCI?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:   Yes, sir.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. COHEN</strong> Would you explain, please?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:   I probably shouldn't say that. I became aware
in the fall of 1985 that Ollie had more contact than I had realized
with the Director and he mentioned, and I think it was entirely offhand
and intended comically at one point to say that the Director
had volunteered a million dollars. And he laughed. And I think it
probably was comic.
But it was expressive of a relationship that surprised me.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. COHEN</strong> Did you come to believe that perhaps Mr. Casey was
giving him instructions in how to conduct this particular operation
with respect to either Nicaragua or Iran?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:   Senator Cohen, I think so.
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. COHEN</strong> In fact, we have evidence that Colonel North was
calling the chief of station in a Central American Country and
having him report to Colonel North. We have an ambassador being
called in Lebanon, having him report to Colonel North.
It is rather clear that Oliver North was acting under the-at
least the aegis of Director Casey during this time?
<br/><br/><strong>Mr. McFARLANE</strong>:   Yes, sir.
