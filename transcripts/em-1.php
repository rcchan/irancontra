<strong>Mr. MEESE</strong>: As Secretary Shultz said in his testimony last week, Our efforts
in the space of just over 3 days turned up the essential facts that
are still the essential facts today. Obviously much more information
and many additional details have been uncovered by the various
investigations, including those by these committees, and the
months of effort that have taken place since that weekend.
But the basic outline of facts that the President and I related to
Congress and to the public on the 25th of November 1986 remains
intact today.<br/><br/>
From the afternoon of Friday, November 21st through the
evening of Monday, November 24th, a number of people were interviewed,
documents were examined, and information was obtained
from the relevant agencies that had participated in the strategic
Iran initiative. Much of the information we obtained has previously
been provided to these committees by the witnesses that have appeared
before you and in the depositions and the documents which
are part of your record.<br/><br/>
Therefore, I will not chronicle in detail the events of that week-
end, but I will, of course,, be happy to respond to any questions you
may have about it.<br/><br/>
During our review, we discovered facts indicating that funds ob-
tained from the arms transfers in Iran had been diverted to the
Democratic Resistance forces in Nicaragua. I brought this information
to the President, who determined that it should be reported
promptly to the Congress and to the American people and that immedi-
ate corrective action should be taken.<br/><br/>
Therefore, on Tuesday, the 25th of November 1986, a briefing for
Congressional leaders was held at 11:00 o'clock and a news conference
was conducted at noon.<br/><br/>
Although our information was by no means complete at that time, and we recognized that much investigative activity would
follow, the President requested that I disclose all that we had
learned to date so that there would be no claim of withholding of
information or charge of coverup.
