Iran-Contra Affair of 1984-1987 was not one affair but two separate covert foreign
policy issues concerning two different problems, in two separate countries,
that were dealt in two very different ways. Under the management of the same
few officials, both the Iran and the Contra policies intersected at certain
points giving rise to the singular title, Iran-Contra Affair.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The first covert foreign policy initiative
was the continued support for the democratic rebel Contras against the
communist Sandinistas in Nicaragua in a time when Congress had cut off funds to
the Contras. The second covert foreign policy initiative was the selling of
arms to Iran in exchange for the release of American hostages held by Iranian
allies in Lebanon. The two policies intersected when profits from the arms
sales to Iran were used to support the Nicaraguan Contras through third parties
and private funds. </p>

and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed in such a way that
structurally allowed them to work around Congress and have the Executive Branch
and third party actors implement and frame the foreign policy of the entire
Unites States. To understand how, one must look historically at the evolution
of these two groups. The beginning starts with the National Security Act of
July 26, 1947. Truman signed this piece of legislation that gave birth
simultaneously to both the National Security Council and the Central
Intelligence Agency. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

facilitate presidential decision making, but it evolved with each
administration until it became structured and powerful enough to perform covert
operations. During Eisenhower's administration in the mid 1950's the NSC became
a virtual adjunct of the presidency.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1'

The NSC staff was now under a special assistant to the President and not the
NSC directly, turning the Presidency into a bureaucracy itself. The Kennedy
administration's changes to the NSC were driven by the Bay of Pigs incident
that left Kennedy skeptical of the traditional departments and led him to
prefer a more direct and personal style of executing policies.<span

Whereas the NSC was previously a planning entity, Kennedy made it also function
operationally. This allowed the executive branch to avoid going through the
State Department. This marked a trend of inflating the Office of the President
and its replication of the rest of the government. The Office of the President
grew in ways that sometimes supported, sometimes competed with, and other times
ignored other governmental agencies and offices. This trend continued with the
Reagan administration. The NSC became further professionalized with a staff of
about forty-five under the National Security Advisor </span><a

Eisenhower did qualify that the covert operations had to be consistent with

font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The U.S. has long intervened in
Nicaraguan affairs, aiming to keep its political developments amicable with and
aligned to American interests. As early as 1912 the U.S. has utilized military
force to quell rebellions against American approved leaders or to help overthrow
unwanted regimes. Therefore, when U.S. trained head of the Nicaraguan National
Guard, Somoza Garcia, forcefully took power in 1936, the U.S. made no move to
protect the current administration under Augusto Cesar Sandino. Sandino's
murder marked the beginning of the Somoza dynastic rule which lasted for the
next 43 years. In 1961, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN),
named in honor of Sandino, was created in opposition to the Somoza dynasty.
Ideologically, the Sandinistas saw themselves as a Marxist-Leninist
organization with aims of turning Nicaragua into a socialist state. Inspired by
and closely connected to Cuba, the Sandinistas worked to create and consolidate
their power in the context of a cold war era where socialist revolutions and uprisings
were gaining in worldwide popularity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>In 1967, Anastasio Somoza Debayle,
son of Somoza Garcia, became president.&nbsp;He became notorious in Nicaragua
for suppressing opposition and focusing on self-enrichment while in power. For
example, in 1972, when an earthquake struck Managua, the capital of Nicaragua,
Somoza exercised emergency powers to address the earthquake which in
actuality resulted in him and his close friends confiscating the majority of
international aid sent to help rebuild Nicaragua. This event consolidated the
Nicaraguan's disapproval of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, especially among the
Sandinistas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

several Nicaraguan elites at a Christmas Party. Somoza responded to the affair by
declaring a state of siege which spiraled into a series of serious human rights
violations and guerilla attacks on peasants. In response, the United States,
hyper-sensitive to the threat of communism and in conjunction with a
contemporaneous trend of protecting human rights victims, began to pay
attention to Nicaraguan affairs for the first time since the Somoza dynasty commenced
in 1936. President Jimmy Carter's foreign policy was shaped not only by a consciousness
of human rights, but also by a fatigue of foreign intervention due to the
Vietnam War. President Carter cut off all aid to the Nicaraguan government
until it improved its human rights violations. Somoza responded by lifting the
state of siege. This was met by the Sandinistas re-initiating and expanding
their attacks which were now supported by business elites including Alfonso
Robelo, and academics, including Adolfo Calero.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

banks, mines, and transit systems, abolish old courts, denounce churches, and

was mid-1980 when Jose Cardenal and Enrique Bermudez founded what would become
the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, or FDN, the main contra group (the Contras).
The Contras found support among the populations disaffected by Sandinista
policies i.e. protestant evangelicals, farmers, Nicaraguan Indians, Creoles, and
other disgruntled and disenfranchised parties. The Argentinean government was
the first to support the Contras. They directly oversaw the Contras, trained
the military forces, and chose the Contra leadership whereas the U.S. took on
the role of supplying money and arms. Many worried that the Contras were a
continuation of the Somoza regime because of their use of brutal tactics
against noncombatants and their alleged human rights abuses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to support resistance forces in Nicaragua including propaganda efforts, but not
including armed action. The Sandinistas supported expanding socialism abroad,
including sending weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador beginning in 1980
and continuing for the next ten years. Some argue that this international
support from Nicaragua was also in effort to insure that the Soviets would
fully support and protect Nicaragua in case of a U.S. attack or

Sandinista's continued support of Salvadoran rebels. In response, the
Sandinistas consolidated power and expanded arrests of perceived dissidents

an order that allowed the CIA to support the Contras with arms, equipment, and
money. This order was implemented in conjunction with an overall strengthening
of U.S. presence in Central America and the belief that covert activities are
the most effective way to put pressure on a regime. <span

Carter administration's non-intervention culminated in June 1982 with the
Reagan Doctrine which called for supporting democratization everywhere. It was
at this point that the goal of the covert operations in Nicaragua shifted away
from one of simply interdicting arms to one of supporting a change in
government. Iran-Contra historian Theodore Draper, among others, argued, that
this was the real goal all the long. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

U.S., wary of losing its oil rich friend, and desperate to keep Soviets from
influencing the region, quickly moved to normalize relations with Iran. Despite
these efforts, the Muslim Followers of the line of the Imam, a fundamentalist,
anti-imperialist group made up predominately of young radical revolutionaries,
seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, symbolizing the end of
cordial diplomacy between the two nations. Fifty-three hostages were taken by
this group and the Iranian government and general public supported their
actions further antagonizing relations between the two former allies. Although
these hostages were eventually released the day of President Reagan's

shipped to Iran in two intervals. First, eighty Hawks would be sent, followed

Schwimmer, who was heading the Israeli operations, applied last minute to get

To help with logistics, North brought Secord on board rather than using someone

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
first effort to get airport clearance was described to the Portuguese Foreign
Ministry as Defex working with a retired American general to ship arms to Iran.
This confused Portuguese officials because of what they understood as the
United States' opposition to all shipments of arms to Iran under Operation
Staunch. Portugal was now skeptical of the whole affair; especially in regards
to who was making this arms shipment request- the United States Government, or
a private citizen. When that request was denied, North worked with Dewey R.
Clarridge, Chief of the European division of the CIA, to help deal with the Lisbon
airport crisis and try again to obtain airport clearance. Portugal firmly
insisted on receiving a formal acknowledgement they were being asked to help
in a weapons shipment as not to later be charged with violating Operation
Staunch.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn22' href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Ultimately
North and Clarridge used an alternate plan utilizing proprietary airline
flights to make the arms shipment. A proprietary airline is such that it is
owned and controlled by the CIA but operates as if it were an ordinary commercial
operation when not utilized for special CIA assignment. When Clarridge decided
to go the proprietary route he informed the CIA controller in Frankfurt that
an urgent fight that was in the interest of the U.S. government would need

shipment method did not run smoothly either, running across problems in Cyprus,
Turkey, and culminating in the realization that the wrong missiles had been

plan</a> that compromised both his and the Iranians' interests. The resulting
agreement was that the U.S. would send Iran 1,500 TOWs in exchange for the
release of 1.5 hostages (1 definitely and the 2<sup>nd</sup> with all
effective possible effort). Iran also offered to pay the U.S. $3.6 million in
addition to releasing the hostages which meant more funds could be diverted to
the Contras. Hakim, serving as a U.S. representative, implemented his
nine-point plan beginning in October 28, 1986 with the first shipment of arms. Of
the $3.6 million Iran paid to the Enterprise, $2 million of this was given to
the CIA who supplied the weapons, and the remaining $1.6 million was diverted
to the Contras. </p>

He told the public that the United States had not traded arms for hostages. He
told the public that the United States had not condoned the arms sales by
Israel to Iran, when in fact he had approved them and signed a Finding, later
destroyed by Poindexter, recording his approval. All of these statements by the
